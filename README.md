# Clinic-Health-Board-Application
A Health Board System that allows users to add staff. clients and visits to the system and to also record the different types of visits that a client may require, for example scheduling visits for bathing, administering drugs etc.

This application was developed using the 3-Tier Architecture with a heavy focus on Object-Orientation and the use of Design Patterns. 

I opted for the Decorator design pattern.

# Save Feature

The Save Feature is used to write the Staff, Client and Visits data to a txt file. This highlights the implementation of the Data Layer

# Load Feature

The Load Feature is used to load the data into the system

# Clear Feature

Erases the data from the system.

# Use of 3-Tier Architecture

This Project has been developed with a heavy focus on the 3-Tier Architecture. The Presentation Layer is the User Interface presented to the user.

The Business Layer contains the data logic that is then used in the Presentation Layer and Data Layer.

The Data Layer is used to handle the data in the files.
